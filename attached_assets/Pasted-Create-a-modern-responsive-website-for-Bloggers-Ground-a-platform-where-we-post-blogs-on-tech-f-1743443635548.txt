Create a modern, responsive website for "Bloggers Ground," a platform where we post blogs on tech, fashion, and various other categories. The website should have the following sections and features:

Home Page:
The home page should feature a large banner section with an image and overlay text highlighting the purpose of the website. Include a catchy headline, sub-headline, and a call-to-action button. Below the banner, there should be a section for "New Arrivals" displaying the most recent blog posts. Another section for "Trending" blogs, showing popular content across different categories like tech, fashion, and lifestyle, should follow. Additionally, include a "Web Stories" section featuring daily stories with engaging images and brief descriptions. A customer reviews section should be placed to display user testimonials, either as a slider or in grid format. Use animations on scroll and page load to enhance the visual experience.

Blog Page:
The blog page should display all blog posts in a clean and modern layout with a 2025-inspired design. Each blog post should have a title, category, brief snippet, author, and publication date. Implement filters for category sorting, and allow users to sort posts by "Most Recent," "Trending," or "Most Popular." Include pagination or infinite scroll for loading posts as the user navigates. A search bar should be prominently displayed, allowing users to search for specific blog content.

Web Stories Page:
On this page, show all available web stories in an engaging grid or list format. Each web story should include an image, title, and brief description. Clicking on a story should open a detailed view or modal. Implement sorting and filtering options by categories like tech, fashion, and others for easier navigation.

About Page:
The about page should briefly explain the mission and vision of Bloggers Ground. Include information about the team and the platform's goals. Add a "Contact Us" section with social media links, email, and an embedded Google Map to show the location of the business or headquarters.

Light/Dark Mode:
Implement a theme toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. Ensure that in dark mode, all text, icons, buttons, and other elements are styled to appear white (or another contrasting color) to ensure readability against the dark background. Smooth transitions between themes are important for a polished user experience.

Login and Sign Up Pages:
The login page should be simple with fields for email and password, along with a "Forgot Password" option. It should also provide social login options (Google, Facebook). The sign-up page should offer fields for name, email, password, and password confirmation. Both pages should have a minimal and user-friendly design.

Additional Features:

Ensure the website is fully accessible, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Optimize the site for SEO by including appropriate meta tags, social sharing data, and structured data.

Use animations and transitions for buttons, links, and interactive elements to improve engagement.

For better performance, implement lazy loading for images and asynchronous data fetching.

Use Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation. This will ensure optimal performance, including fast page loading times and SEO optimization.

Implement state management, such as React Context or Redux, for handling global states like theme switching and user authentication.

Make sure the website is fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Additional Considerations:

Integrate analytics (like Google Analytics) to track user behavior and interactions.

Consider adding a notification system for new blog posts or updates on web stories.

Users should be able to create profiles, save favorite blogs, and leave comments on posts.

Provide an easy-to-navigate footer with important links, like Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and contact information.
